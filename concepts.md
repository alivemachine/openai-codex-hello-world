# Computational Construction

A computation is a map between systems or states of the world. Literally it tells you or a computer how to take one system and get another system.

Usually our concerns as computer users are to create Reliable, Efficient maps.  That is, we wish to have consistent ***outputs*** from consistent ***inputs***.   

Sometimes we wish to do more ***generative*** things where the inputs and outputs don't consistently match, but do maintain some sense of reliable coherence... e.g. i wish to generate random numbers by sayhing "generate random numbers"... even when it's gene
